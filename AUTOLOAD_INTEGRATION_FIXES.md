# Autoload System Integration Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes applied to the Blackstar project's autoload system integration.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Cross-Dependencies Between Autoloads
**Problem**: ShiftManager was connecting to signals from PatientLoader and TimerSystem in `_ready()` without ensuring those autoloads were fully initialized.

**Solution**: 
- Added deferred signal connections in ShiftManager using `call_deferred("_connect_autoload_signals")`
- Added proper error handling and availability checks before connecting signals
- Added duplicate connection prevention

### 2. Missing Error Handling in Method Calls
**Problem**: Scenes were calling autoload methods without checking if the autoloads were available or if the methods existed.

**Solution**:
- Added null checks and method existence validation using `has_method()`
- Added comprehensive error handling in Main.gd, GameScene.gd, and ResultsScene.gd
- Replaced direct method calls with safe calls that include error handling

### 3. Signal Connection Mismatches
**Problem**: GameScene.gd was connecting to `_on_patient_completed` but the function was named `_on_patient_loaded`.

**Solution**:
- Fixed the function name to match the signal connection
- Added proper signal availability checks before connecting

### 4. Inconsistent Variable Naming
**Problem**: TimerSystem had inconsistent variable naming (`timer_paused` vs `timer_is_paused`).

**Solution**:
- Standardized variable naming to `timer_paused_state`
- Updated all references throughout the file

### 5. Insufficient Input Validation
**Problem**: Autoload methods didn't validate input parameters.

**Solution**:
- Added validation for timer duration (must be > 0)
- Added validation for time addition/subtraction values
- Added checks for active timers before performing operations

### 6. Poor Error Reporting
**Problem**: Many error conditions used `print()` instead of proper error reporting.

**Solution**:
- Replaced `print()` statements with `push_error()` for critical errors
- Used `push_warning()` for non-critical issues
- Added descriptive error messages with system prefixes

## Files Modified

### Core Autoloads
- `/scripts/core/ShiftManager.gd` - Added deferred signal connections and error handling
- `/scripts/core/PatientLoader.gd` - Improved error handling and validation
- `/scripts/core/TimerSystem.gd` - Fixed variable naming and added input validation

### UI Scripts  
- `/scripts/ui/Main.gd` - Added autoload availability checks and error handling
- `/scripts/ui/GameScene.gd` - Fixed signal connections and added comprehensive error handling
- `/scripts/ui/ResultsScene.gd` - Added autoload method availability checks

### Test Scripts
- `/scripts/core/AutoloadTest.gd` - Created integration test script for validation

## Autoload Configuration

The project.godot file correctly configures the autoloads in the proper order:

```ini
[autoload]
ShiftManager="*res://scripts/core/ShiftManager.gd"
PatientLoader="*res://scripts/core/PatientLoader.gd"
TimerSystem="*res://scripts/core/TimerSystem.gd"
```

## Testing

To verify the autoload system integration:

1. Run the game and check for any error messages in the console
2. The AutoloadTest.gd script can be added to a test scene to validate functionality
3. All scenes should now gracefully handle missing autoloads or methods

## Error Handling Patterns

The following patterns are now consistently used throughout the codebase:

```gdscript
# Check autoload availability and method existence
if SomeAutoload and SomeAutoload.has_method("some_method"):
    SomeAutoload.some_method()
else:
    push_error("SomeAutoload not available or missing some_method")

# Signal connection with safety checks
if SomeAutoload and SomeAutoload.has_signal("some_signal"):
    if not SomeAutoload.some_signal.is_connected(_on_some_signal):
        SomeAutoload.some_signal.connect(_on_some_signal)
else:
    push_warning("SomeAutoload or some_signal not available")
```

## Benefits

1. **Robust Initialization**: The game can start successfully even if some autoloads fail to initialize
2. **Clear Error Reporting**: Developers can easily identify autoload-related issues
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Missing functionality is handled gracefully with appropriate fallbacks
4. **Maintainable Code**: Consistent error handling patterns make the codebase easier to maintain
5. **Debug Friendly**: Comprehensive logging helps with debugging autoload issues
